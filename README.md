## Description

This project is a portfolio designed to advertise my work to possible employers and collaborators. It was specified to only consist of HTML and CSS and must be deployed as a live site. The time for this project was a week after just having learnt HTML and CSS, currently the website is stable and a bit simple, but with further enhancements and growth of knowledge, it will be revised.

### Purpose
The purpose was to gain experience in designing, developing and deploying a site from scratch, to display current and future projects to possible employers.

### Functionality
I designed my portfolio to have a simple design with an easy flow of information, instead of hiding information behind multiple links.
I made an effort to make this website as responsive as possible, and I am still learning of different methods that I will later implement.

### Sitemap
As a single page scroll, my portfolio website is broken up into sections, navigatable from the menu bar or by scrolling:
* About Me: a short biography.
* Portfolio: links to GitHub repos.
* Contact: form to contact me via netlify.


### Target Audience
my target audience is future employers and collaborators.
I hope my portfolio website showcases my coding abilities, be it in the languages I have knowledge of, functionality of my projects or even the creativity I have displayed within brainstorming sessions. I aspire to become a full-stack developer and I'm excited as to what I may achieve in the future as I continue to learn and develop new skills.

## Design Process and Documentation
### Brainstorming

When brain storming for ideas, I quickly found I had way to many, I was lost down the rabbit hole with the endless possible formats and designs.  Trying to come up with a clear plan was extremely difficult.  

I started looking for images that I liked posessing bold designs and colors that could have easily over powered my sites purpose. After realizing that this would only amount to a cluttered page or pages(at the time) and taking into account my limited time and experience, I decided on a minimalist approach. 

After researching minimalistic designs, I decided to start with a blank page and focus on a clear and familiar layout and the design elements will be filled in as I coded. In the end I quite like the white page with pastel blue, I have found it to be like a canvas I can add to instead of scraping away paint to find something I believe to be visually appealing.

### Colour Scheme
originaly I was solely focused on a black design, with the illusion of professionalism, this was in a way a good plan, but seeing as the design was to be a representation of ourselves, the darkness in this idea didn't sit well with me, after looking at different images for inspiration, I found myself drawn towards lighter colors, more specifically pastels. With the minimalistic approach, I had already decided on using mostly black, white and one other, in this case light blue.

## Project Plan and Timeline

The plan for this project, was to have the research done within the first few days, and then move on to designing the wire frame and organizing ideas on figma, by the fourth day I had begun to code the entire page layout without thinking much the pages movements and aligning div's (very messy). The day before the deadline I had my base 3/4 finished, but had obvious issues, so on the day of the deadline I did the unthinkable... A complete overhaul...sigh.

Even though this may sound like it's been a disaster and trust me I really do agree, I have managed to learn an incredible amount from this experience and am incredibly proud of what I achieved, strangely this has made me energized and more determined than ever to learn more, code more and remember my mistakes, so I won't repeat them.




### Challenges
The hardest thing for me was my time management, i spent way too much time concerned with the design and desperately getting every cool idea i had, on to my site. Another issue was becoming frustrated when the few clear thoughts i had become muddle due to my lack of coding experience. These issues were repeating themselves and the actual problem was, aiming way to high and not relying on what i did understand and was confident in doing.

### Further Enhancements

In regard to future development, this something i see as never ending. as I grow as a developer, i will make many changes to this project, though I want to keep it as pure HTML and CSS as a challenge aspect.

The real enhancements i want to add is when clicking my logo it turns into a broken negative sight, with glitching images and erratic text animations.

* use grid especially in relation to the displaying my projects.
* hover animations
* page animations
* a search by coding languages to isolate projects that i use it for.

Also I had thought of making a video of snips from my fav shows/movies/games and making it as a pop up when my picture in the about section is clicked.




## Short Answers

### Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)

In the early 1980s the Internet was still a bunch of LAN networks yet to be fully linked together, in the late 1980s the world wide web was formed and accessibility to it's information was slowly becoming a reality to the average person, in the mid 1990s the web was no longer a net work to purely connect universities for research, but was a new tool for learning and quickened long distant communication, with the increased traffic and the believe that the web could benefit everyone, it turned into what it is today. 


### Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

Domains were created to make it easier and quicker for information to move on the internet, by telling the computer that something was a .com it was aware to look in the .coms for the website that it is sending/retrieving data from, by adding.au (.com.au) it knows to look in the subgroup.au of the.com.

HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. This is a underlying protocol used by the Web to communicate to web servers how the message should be formatted and transmitted and how to respond to the different commands.

The DNS translates a website domain name to an IP address so the browser can locate the actual location to send/receive data.


### Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)

I think it becoming available to the whole world's population is probably the greatest thing, though not always in a good way (*cough*cough social media *cough*) sorry tickle... it's access to information all around the world of different knowledge and beliefs has improved humanity as a whole, starting from pooling research to varying opinions to freely sharing ideas and solution is truly something to marvel at, we now have the ability to learn from others by a post on a website, to ask questions at any impromptu time and get an instant response, instead of forgetting the question cause you don't know who to ask.
